## Why Not IINA

[IINA](https://iina.io) is a wrapper of [mpv player](https://mpv.io) with lots of features implemented.

I found an issue for IINA. Key control like `.` (step forward) or `,` (step backward) do not support consecutive press. An important feature to me.

I investigated the [source code of IINA](https://github.com/iina/iina) and learned to support consecutive press. Use `int mpv_command(mpv_handle *ctx, const char **args);` instead of the more error prone way `int mpv_command_string(mpv_handle *ctx, const char *args);` and pass commands with `keyDown` and `keyUp` events will do it.

But IINA has its own layer of key management which means it requires a lot of work to do.

You can have look at [the PR](https://github.com/typcn/bilibili-mac-client/pull/163/files) I created for [bilibili-mac-client](https://github.com/typcn/bilibili-mac-client) years ago for how to implement both `keyDown` and `keyUp` event.
